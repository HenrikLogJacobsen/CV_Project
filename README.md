# Project

## Short Project description
This final project challenges you to apply your computer vision knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Choose from four exciting tracks:  tracking for analyzing sports performance, 3D medical image segmentation to aid in diagnosis, exploring object detection for autonomous driving or getting creative with generative models in compute vision.

We have chosen to explore object detection for autonomous driving

## Tips from project description
- <b>Performance Metrics:</b> We expect you to at least measure the COCO mAP@0.5:0.95 metric in
addition to inference speed.

- <b>Recommended Loss Function:</b> Cross-entropy loss is a common choice for multi-class segmen-
tation tasks in autonomous driving, aiming to correctly classify each pixel in the image.

# TODO:
- Load in data
- Experiment with Ultralytics
