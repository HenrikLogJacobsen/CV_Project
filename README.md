# Project

## Short Project description
This final project challenges you to apply your computer vision knowledge to solve a real-world problem. Choose from four exciting tracks:  tracking for analyzing sports performance, 3D medical image segmentation to aid in diagnosis, exploring object detection for autonomous driving or getting creative with generative models in compute vision.

We have chosen to explore object detection for autonomous driving
